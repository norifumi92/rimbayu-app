# About This Project

Heads up! This README is geared toward developers who want to see how this app is built.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This is a React app powered by Vite for fast development and optimized builds. It all started with the magic command npm create vite@latest, and the whole development process has been supported by Claude Code. The app is hosted on Vercel.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation & Running Locally

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 📦 Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **React**: ^19.1.1
- **React DOM**: ^19.1.1

### Development Dependencies
- **Vite**: ^7.1.2
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: ^5.0.0
- **ESLint**: ^9.33.0 (with React hooks and refresh plugins)
- **TypeScript Types**: @types/react ^19.1.10, @types/react-dom ^19.1.7

## 🌐 Deployment

I’d suggest using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host this app. It’ll pick up Vita automatically, so you can deploy and get the app live in no time—no manual setup needed.
